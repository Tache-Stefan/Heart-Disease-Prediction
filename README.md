# Heart Disease Risk Prediction  

A machine learning project that predicts the risk of heart disease based on patient health indicators.  
Built with **XGBoost**, feature engineering, and an interactive **Streamlit web app** with explainability (SHAP).

## Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how **machine learning** can help assess patient risk factors and provide interpretable insights for medical decision support.  

Key highlights:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering**  
- **XGBoost model** with hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE balancing  
- **Explainability** using SHAP
- **Interactive web app** built with Streamlit for user-friendly predictions
